0.08  Mon Jan 15, 2001
        - Fixed signal handler that went out of scope
        - Prepared for SWISH-E 2.2.  Namely, made the results
          callback method ($hit->property) use the (at this time)
          standard names for the fields, and provide access to all
          data (swish internal data such as rank, title, file name, and
          properties) through method calls on the $hit object.
        - test.pl updated, and tested against 1.2.4, 1.3.2, 2.0.4.
